# TelegramOpenai

I have prepared a telegrambot integrated into the chatgpt api, the popular application of the last months, the latest product of openai. With this bot, it offers suggestions to chatgpt over telegram to improve your English grammar.

# npm packages
-> npm i config
-> npm i node-telegram-bot-api
-> npm i openai

# what you need to do before you can use it
-> Telegram:  first, find the botfather bot on telegram and get yourself a bot token, then fill in "TelegramBotToken" in "\config\default.json"
Detail doc: https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial 

-> Chatgpt:  Get the api key from the openai site https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys and write it to "OpeniaToken" on the token page.

-> After downloading the application to your local, you can run it by npm start, then you can talk to your application in telegram.

This is how it works :)
